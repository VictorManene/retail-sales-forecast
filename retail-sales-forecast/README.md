# retail-sales-forecast
This Time Series Forecasting Capstone repo delivers a comprehensive pipeline to predict the Advance Real Retail Sales (RSXFS) series—an inflation‑adjusted monthly measure of U.S. consumer spending— from data ingestion through advanced modeling and an interactive Streamlit dashboard. You’ll find step‑by‑step scripts for fetching and cleaning FRED data, engineering temporal and external features, benchmarking models (Naïve, Holt–Winters, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and an ensemble), and hyperparameter tuning. The Holt–Winters model emerges as the top performer (MAPE 3.85 %), with clear guidance on further enhancements. Clone this repo to reproduce the forecasts, explore the dashboards, and extend the methodology.
